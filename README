Introduction:
============
PyTesser is an Optical Character Recognition module for Python. It takes 
as input an image or image file and outputs a string.

PyTesser uses the Tesseract OCR engine (an Open Source project at Google), 
converting images to an accepted format and calling the Tesseract 
executable as an external script. 

A modification is made for this application to run on Mac instead of just windows

Dependencies:
=============
Pillow is required to work with images in memory. PyTesser has been tested with Python 2.7 in OSx. 
https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/master/docs/index.rst


Installation:
==============
1. compile tesseract - https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/Compiling
  
    brew install tesseract
    
1. (optional) - use virtualenv / virtualenvwrapper to create new environment
    
    mkvirtualenv pytesseract
    
1. install python dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.pip
    


Usage:
================================
>>> from pytesser import *
>>> im = Image.open('phototest.tif')
>>> text = image_to_string(im)
>>> print text
This is a lot of 12 point text to test the
ocr code and see if it works on all types
of file format.
